First, install nbautoexprort and register it so all .ipynb files saved under notebooks/ folder will be automatically
converted into .py (code, under script/) and .html (outputs, under html/) files.
When creating a new folder under notebook/, add a configuration file (the .nbautoexport works nonrecursively), with:
$ nbautoexport configure <path to folder> -f script -f html --organize-by extension
Go here for more details - https://pypi.org/project/nbautoexport/

To work on a notebook on a different machine (e.g. open locally a git notebook), you have to first convert it into
a jupyter notebook, using:
$ jupytext --to notebook <path to .py file>
Then move the file one level up to its notebooks nbautoexport configured folder and re-run the notebook. Saving it
will now create both .py and .html files in their folders. 
Careful - the output file will be replaced with the new local one when pushing to the repository.
